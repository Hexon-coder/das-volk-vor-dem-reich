Panagis_Tsaldaris_desc:0 "Panagis Tsaldaris lived a comfortable life. Born in Corinth in 1868, Tsaldaris lived a life of relative ease and comfort, earning his law degree from first the University of Athens, and then getting his Doctorate at Paris and Oxford, and then running and earning a Parliment seat in his home town in 1910. After an unexpected loss in the 1920 Elections, Tsalgaris regained his seat in 1924, soon afterwards becoming quite influential in the Freethinkers Party, and managing to secure the appointment of Prime Minister by 1930. Now, as Greece blooms in yet another year of economic prosperity, Tsalgaris must turn his eyes on other matters, IE, the two million Greeks still living under foreign rule. A nationalist and proponer of the Megali, Tsalgaris will not rest until his homeland is liberated and strong under Hellas."

POLITICS_NICHOLAS_2_DESC:0 "Born Nikolai Alexandrovich Romanov on the 18th May 1868, Nicholas II's path to becoming Tsar was not a luxurious one. When he was only 12, Alexander III ascended to the throne after the assassination of Alexander II, the ''Tsar Liberator'' and the grandfather of the young prince. Upon inheriting the throne in 1994, Nicholas learned from the hardened resolve of his father to resist any liberal or revolutionary idea within the Russian Empire but was relatively relaxed with censorship and use of the Okhrana. Despite the stern attitude of his father, Nicholas was uninterested in being the Tsar and was inexperienced for the job. His general incompetence was exposed during the humiliating Russo-Japanese War and the resulting 1905 Revolution. Despite the attempt to appease the revolutionaries by passing the October Manifesto in 1905, he retained his autocratic powers with the 1906 Fundamental Laws. Even though his actions angered opposition across the Empire, the popularity of the Romanovs remained high and massively increased after the victory against Austria-Hungary. With the annexation of Galicia, the Russian Empire continued to expand and soon found itself marching Russian troops through the hills of Manchuria. The future for Russia looks increasingly bright but unrest continues. The increased use of the Okhrana by the Tsar has struck fear into his population but has further exposed Russian political weakness. The main key to Russian prosperity is a continued friendship with Germany and Serbia and any failure to do so could have severe consequences for Russia. At the moment, Nicholas II continues to be the dominating force in Russian government but the question is not who holds the power but instead how capable is he in wielding this power. Opposition remains strong but disunited while the West continues to speed ahead of Russia. The task of catching up with the West has so far been unachievable but new opportunities might turn the tide for the Russian Empire..."

POLITICS_ABDULMEJID_II_DESC0: "Named the Crown Prince after his cousin, Mehmet VI took the throne, Abdulmejid had never been fond of politics and war, preferring instead to paint, and was widely renowned as one of the greatest artists in Turkey. Being plunged into power in 1926 when Mehmet died, he has spent much of his reign trying to keep morale and opinion high, as he plots to reclaim his power from the Triumvirate."
