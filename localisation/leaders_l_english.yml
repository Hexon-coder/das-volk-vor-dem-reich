Panagis_Tsaldaris_desc:0 "Panagis Tsaldaris lived a comfortable life. Born in Corinth in 1868, Tsaldaris lived a life of relative ease and comfort, earning his law degree from first the University of Athens, and then getting his Doctorate at Paris and Oxford, and then running and earning a Parliment seat in his home town in 1910. After an unexpected loss in the 1920 Elections, Tsalgaris regained his seat in 1924, soon afterwards becoming quite influential in the Freethinkers Party, and managing to secure the appointment of Prime Minister by 1930. Now, as Greece blooms in yet another year of economic prosperity, Tsalgaris must turn his eyes on other matters, IE, the two million Greeks still living under foreign rule. A nationalist and proponer of the Megali, Tsalgaris will not rest until his homeland is liberated and strong under Hellas."
